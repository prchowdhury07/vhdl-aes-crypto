Using VHDL and testing with Altera DE1 board, will implement the Advanced Encryption Standard. Will have a software client to pass data to the device over a serial connection.

This project will be used as an exercise to practice correct usage of VHDL constructs in synthesis. Will develop proper VHDL testbenches and simulations.
